# cra-template-cleanest
 
 A template with almost the bare minimum to create a react app.
 
 ## How to use:
 
 While creating a new react-app, use the argument ```--template cleanest```, like this:
 
 ```
 npx creact-react-app <projectname> --template cleanest
 ```

 ## Importante to notice:
  - StrictMode is kept, but any testing tools must added.
  - I setted up a reset css file, but it mighty not be good for you
  - The file robot.txt now blocks the content, but can disturb your testing
  - README file is empty
  - index.html and manifest.json files don't have most of its metadata

**Your new installed react app will look as shown bellow:**
